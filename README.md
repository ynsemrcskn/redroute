# RedRoute: Visualize Your Network ðŸš¦

![RedRoute](https://img.shields.io/badge/RedRoute-Conceptual%20Network%20Simulation-blue)

Welcome to the **RedRoute** repository! This project serves as a powerful tool for visualizing and computing the shortest path between two hosts in a complex network topology. Built with Python and utilizing libraries such as NetworkX, Tkinter, and Matplotlib, RedRoute enhances your understanding of network routing by displaying paths, nodes, and their interconnections.

## Features

- **Visual Pathfinding**: See the shortest path between any two hosts in real-time.
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Graphical representation of nodes and connections.
- **Routing Algorithms**: Implements various routing strategies for better pathfinding.
- **Simulation Capabilities**: Simulate different network scenarios to test routing strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for the application.
- **NetworkX**: A library for creating and manipulating complex networks.
- **Tkinter**: The standard GUI toolkit for Python.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting graphs and visualizing data.

## Installation

To get started with RedRoute, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ynsemrcskn/redroute.git
   cd redroute
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can start visualizing network paths. Hereâ€™s how to use RedRoute:

1. **Input Hosts**: Enter the names or identifiers of the two hosts you want to analyze.
2. **Select Routing Algorithm**: Choose from the available routing strategies.
3. **Visualize**: Click the "Find Path" button to see the shortest path displayed on the graphical interface.

## How It Works

RedRoute operates by creating a graph representation of the network topology. Each host is a node, and each connection is an edge. The application uses NetworkX to compute the shortest path based on the selected algorithm.

1. **Graph Creation**: The network topology is defined as a graph where nodes represent hosts and edges represent connections.
2. **Pathfinding**: When a user inputs two hosts, the selected routing algorithm calculates the shortest path.
3. **Visualization**: The results are displayed using Matplotlib, allowing users to see the path on the graph.
